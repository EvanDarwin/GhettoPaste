GhettoPaste
===

Welcome to GhettoPaste, a project allowing you to upload more of your useless text, even faster.

Powered by CiyA (The CloudÂ© in your ass), allows you to upload your worthless text as fast as the speed of light. With absolutely no redundancy or version tracking abilities, we honestly have no idea why you'd use this piece of shit, or even why you're still reading this.

The Goal
---
Make the stupidest application that somehow works in as few files as possible.

Currently standing:
* 2 PHP files
* 1 HTML file


Installation
---
Set up nginx so that it's pointing to the public folder, and include that wonderful nginx.conf file of ours.

We're not actually going to assist you in installing this.

License
---
Released under the MIT license (implying anybody would want to improve on this).
